        <p>Hi, this is Reina Joyce P. Suazo, I am a BSIT student, a determined and focused individual who values personal growth.I am a thoughtful and fair person who values order and independence. I prefer deep connections over small talk and sometimes need space when feeling overwhelmed. Creativity is a big part of me I love art and storytelling, and I like things to be clear and organized. I may be quiet, but I am determined and strong, always pushing myself to do better. While I enjoy being independent, I also appreciate kindness and honesty in others, and I deeply respect wise and genuine people.
